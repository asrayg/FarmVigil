FarmVigil is a cutting-edge computer vision model designed to identify diseases in large cattle herds, all powered by Roboflow and an SMS API.

Key Features
High Precision: Our MVP boasts an impressive 96% precision rate in detecting one of the most common cattle diseases - snotty noses.

Expandable: Our vision extends beyond snotty noses. We have ambitious plans to broaden our model's capabilities by incorporating additional symptoms, diseases, and a wider range of cattle health concerns.

Real-time Monitoring: Our system continuously captures images from security cameras, analyzing each frame using advanced computer vision techniques. When a symptom is detected, it promptly notifies the farmer via SMS.

Future-Ready: We have exciting plans to develop a dedicated mobile app. This app will provide comprehensive health statistics for each individual cattle based on their unique ear tags, aiding farmers in targeted healthcare management.
